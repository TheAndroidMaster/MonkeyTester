# MonkeyTester

This app was made in order to determine whether a user is a monkey, a goat, or both, depending on booleans obtained from android's ActivityManager and UserManager.

According to the android developer documentation, if you are a monkey it means that you or someone else has messed with the user interface, however all we know for the goat is that as of lollipop, it uses an advanced goat recognition algorithm.
